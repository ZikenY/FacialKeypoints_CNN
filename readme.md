--- Objective ---

The objective of this task is using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to predict keypoint positions on face images.

--- Data description ---

The data is from Kaggle, which contains a set of face images. The input image consists of a list of 96*96 pixels.

Each predicted keypoint is specified by an (x,y) real-valued pair in the space of pixel indices. 15 keypoints in the dataset represent the different elements of the face (left_eye_center, right_eye_center, nose_tip â€¦);

The input image is given in the last field of the data files, consists of a list of pixels, as integers in (0,255). The images are 96x96 pixels;

The training data contains a list of 7049 images. Each row contains the (x,y) coordinates for 15 keypoints, and image data as row-ordered list of pixels;

Test data contains a list of 1783 test images. Each row contains ImageId and image data as row-ordered list of pixels.
